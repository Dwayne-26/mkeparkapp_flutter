# MKEPark Flutter

CitySmart’s MKEPark experience is a cross-platform Flutter app focused on
parking insights, ticket reminders, and municipal workflows for Milwaukee
drivers. This repository contains:

- The Flutter client (Android, iOS, web, desktop stubs).
- Backend scaffolding (FastAPI stub under `backend/`) used for development.
- Tooling to manage Firebase secrets, CI builds, and automated versioning.

## Highlights
- 🚗 Real-time parking risk indicators, permit workflows, and reporting flows.
- 🔔 Firebase Cloud Messaging integration for alerts and local notifications.
- 🔒 Secrets-managed builds via `scripts/flutter_with_secrets.sh` so no Firebase
  credentials live in git.
- 🧪 GitHub Actions pipelines for Android/iOS builds (`mobile_build.yml`).
- 🔁 Automatic pubspec version bumps on commits to `main`
  (`.github/workflows/auto_version.yml`).

## Requirements
- Flutter `3.35.7` (or whichever version you pin in `env.FLUTTER_VERSION`).
- Dart SDK ≥ `3.9.2`.
- Xcode `16.1` (for iOS builds) with the iOS 18.1 platform installed.
- Android SDK + NDK 27, CMake 3.22, Java 17 toolchain.
- Firebase CLI (for App Distribution/beta deployments).

## Local Setup
1. Install Flutter and ensure `flutter doctor` passes for your target platforms.
2. Copy secrets template and fill in real values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.firebase.example .env.firebase
   # edit and point to secure google-services.json / GoogleService-Info.plist files
   ```
3. Run Flutter commands through the helper script so configs are injected:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/flutter_with_secrets.sh pub get
   ./scripts/flutter_with_secrets.sh run -d ios
   ./scripts/flutter_with_secrets.sh build apk --release
   ```
4. Use VS Code/Android Studio normally once the native config files are copied.

## Firebase Secrets & CI
- Sensitive files (`android/app/google-services.json`,
  `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`, etc.) live outside git in `.secrets/`.
- `.env.firebase` stores all `--dart-define` values and file paths. It is
  git-ignored; share via secure channels only.
- `docs/SECRETS.md` describes how to encode these secrets for GitHub Actions.
- GitHub secrets expected by `mobile_build.yml`:
  - `FIREBASE_ENV_FILE` – entire `.env.firebase`.
  - `ANDROID_GOOGLE_SERVICES_JSON` – base64 of `google-services.json`.
  - `IOS_GOOGLE_SERVICE_INFO_PLIST` – base64 of `GoogleService-Info.plist`.

## Automated Versioning
- Every push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/auto_version.yml`.
- `scripts/bump_version.py` increments the `pubspec.yaml` version line
  (patch + build number) and commits back using the GitHub Actions bot.
- Skip the bump by adding `[skip version]` to your commit message or pushing
  from a branch other than `main`.
- Manual bumps remain possible—just edit `pubspec.yaml` before merging.

## CI/CD Overview
- **`mobile_build.yml`**  
  Builds Android release APKs (Ubuntu runners) and iOS unsigned IPAs (macOS 15
  runners + Xcode 16.1). Artifacts are uploaded for download/testing.
- **`auto_version.yml`**  
  Runs immediately after merges to `main` so the repo always has a fresh build
  number.
- Extend either workflow with Fastlane or Firebase App Distribution to push QA
  builds. Add steps after the build stage:
  ```bash
  firebase appdistribution:distribute build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk \
    --app <ANDROID_FIREBASE_APP_ID> --groups beta --release-notes "Build $GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER"
  ```

## Useful Scripts
- `scripts/flutter_with_secrets.sh` – wraps any `flutter` command, copies secret
  config files, and forwards all Firebase dart-defines.
- `scripts/bump_version.py` – increments the `pubspec.yaml` version string.
- `scripts/create_citysmart_bundle.sh` – exports assets for marketing demos.

## Project Structure
- `lib/` – Flutter code organized by screens, services, providers, theme.
- `backend/` – FastAPI health check stub for local integration tests.
- `docs/` – Integration + secrets documentation.
- `.github/workflows/` – CI definitions (build + auto versioning).

## Next Steps / Deployment
- Configure Firebase App Distribution (or Fastlane) for Android/iOS to send
  builds to testers.
- Add signing credentials to GitHub secrets if you plan to upload automatically
  to Google Play/App Store.
- Wire the `backend/` API routes to live services for parking predictions,
  device registration, and reporting.

Happy building! 🚀
